<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">A <strong>laptop</strong> is a small, portable personal computer with a screen and alphanumeric keyboard. Laptops are designed for mobile use and are often powered by a rechargeable battery. They are commonly used in a variety of settings, including work, education, and personal entertainment, due to their portability and flexibility.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">For more information, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop">Wikipedia page on laptops</a>. Laptops vary in size and functionality, with some optimized for heavy computational tasks, such as gaming or video editing, while others prioritize lightweight and efficient battery use for basic tasks.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=7 data-line-end=8 ><a id="Types_of_Laptops_7"></a>Types of Laptops</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">Laptops come in various types tailored to different uses and user preferences. <strong>Ultrabooks</strong>, for example, are slim, lightweight models that focus on performance and battery life, often suited for business professionals or students needing portability. Ultrabooks are commonly powered by SSDs and have less powerful graphics cards.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11"><strong>Gaming laptops</strong> are high-performance models built to handle intense computational tasks like gaming and graphic design. They typically have dedicated GPUs, high-refresh-rate displays, and enhanced cooling systems. However, gaming laptops are usually heavier and have shorter battery lives due to the hardware they carry.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">Another popular category is the <strong>2-in-1 laptops</strong>, which feature a touchscreen and flexible hinges allowing them to be used in various modes, such as a tablet. This versatility makes 2-in-1s a popular choice for users who want both a laptop and tablet in one device.</p>
